To create single object, we can use Object constructor (ie. new Object()) and object literal. But it is not a good idea to create multiple objects with the same interfaces. Then it comes to an approach named factory pattern, but the cons of it is there is no way to find the type of objects created in this way. So we introduced constructor pattern.
the factory pattern is quite similar to constructor, difference is:
	*There is no object being created explicitly
	*The properties and method are assigned directly onto the *this* object
	*No *return* statement
What happens behind the scene when *new* a object
    1. Create a new object
    2. Assign the *this* value of the constructor to the new object(so *this* points to the new object )
    3. Execute the code inside the constructor (adds properties to the new object)
    4. Return the new object
All the objects created this way has a *constructor* property which points to constructor function unless changed delibrately.
