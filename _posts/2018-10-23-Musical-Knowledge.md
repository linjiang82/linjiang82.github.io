*Major Pattern is Whole-Whole-Semi-Whole-Whole-Whole-Semi  
*Minor Pattern is Whole-Semi-Whole-Whole-Semi-Whole-Whole  

Key signature: designate which note will be the 'do', and how other notes flattened or sharpened to keep the Major or Minor pattern.  
E.g. G Major means G will be played as 'do', thus to keep the Major Pattern, F has to be sharpened, conversly when seeing one # next to the clef, the clef changed from C major to a G major. And the # will be placed on the F note which is on 5th line.
